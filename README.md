IdeaBox was a group project assigned to us (Emily Dittmer, Jacqueline Moore, and Aidan McKay) to solidify our HTML/CSS skills and strengthen our JavaScript concepts.

We were asked to recreate a UI layout as well as implement some functionality including the ability to add, delete, and edit ideas. A user is hypothetically able to change the quality of an idea between three states. They would be able to filter the ideas by quality as well as by most recently created. A user would also be able to search the titles and bodies of ideas using a search bar. The search results would update as a user typed.
